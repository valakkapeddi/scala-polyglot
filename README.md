#### Java & Scala Polyglot Sandbox with Maven

This is a sandbox project to play around with building Scala and Java sources in the same project, currently with Maven.  Core "business" logic is implemented in Java - just some dummy data serialized to XML - and is tested in Scala, and exposed through a web service also written in Scala using Spray.
